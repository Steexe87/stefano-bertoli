            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <ul>
		<p>
Hi, I‚Äôm Stefano Bertoli.<br><br>
I was born in Gardone Val Trompia on November 15, 1987, and from nearby Lumezzane, my journey began ‚Äì not only a geographical one ‚Äì gradually leading me down from Val Trompia, through the colors and rhythms of the Brescia province, until I arrived in Franciacorta. Today, I live in Passirano with my wife Isabella and our wonderful little explorer, Ofelia.<br><br>

I truly love the place we live. Franciacorta has a special kind of magic: orderly vineyards, warm light, and sunsets that look like paintings. It‚Äôs a place that invites you to slow down, breathe deeply, and reflect.<br><br>

I strongly believe in the power of <strong>leading by example</strong>. It‚Äôs my compass‚Äîboth in my personal life and in my professional one. Since becoming a father, this principle has become even more central to me. I believe the world needs authentic, kind, and genuine people. I‚Äôm not an expert in personal branding, but I‚Äôm not afraid to show who I really am‚Äîwhether I‚Äôm in front of the President of the United States (hasn‚Äôt happened yet!) or chatting with a smiling Balinese artisan.<br><br>

For 12 years, I first built a solid management system and then oversaw the entire equipment inventory of a large multinational company (Copan Italia), a world leader in swab production (yes, the famous Covid swabs!). From internal calibrations to external ones, including ‚Äúfirst aid‚Äù maintenance to ensure production was never halted, I handled it all. If anyone needs help managing their company's measuring instruments, I‚Äôd be happy to share my experience and know-how.<br><br>

In my spare time‚Äîwhen I manage to find some‚ÄîI nurture two great passions.<br><br>

The first is video games. I‚Äôve been playing since the Amiga days, then came the Game Boy, and from there I followed the evolution of gaming all the way to today. I‚Äôve always been fascinated by video games: they‚Äôre portals to alternate universes, where you can be whoever you want‚Äîand when you‚Äôre ready, you can return to the real world. A break from life, without losing touch with it.<br><br>

The second is travel. I love discovering new cultures, noticing subtle differences, and learning from different perspectives. Every journey, big or small, is an opportunity for personal growth. Because every place teaches you something‚Äîif you approach it with open eyes and an open heart.
